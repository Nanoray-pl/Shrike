# Release notes

## Upcoming release

* Improved some XML docs.

## 3.0.0
Released 19 December 2023.

* Updated to Shrike 3.0.0.
* You can now do a lot of actions like `CreateLdlocInstruction` directly on `ElementMatch<CodeInstruction>` values. These methods will try to directly return values of correct types, or references to them via `ObjectRef`/`NullableObjectRef`/`StructRef`/`NullableStructRef` types.
* Added a lot of missing `ILMatches` methods, like `Ldflda` or `LdcR4`.
