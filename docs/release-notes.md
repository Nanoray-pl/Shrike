# Release notes

## 3.0.0
Released 19 December 2023.

* Major architecture rewrite, while keeping all the functionality.

* Anchoring functionality is now hidden behind the `.Anchors()` namespacing method.

## 2.0.0
Released 9 May 2023.

* Changed `ISequenceMatcher.Insert` declaration: `bool includeInsertionInResultingBounds` is now `SequenceMatcherInsertionResultingBounds resultingBounds`, with values `ExcludingInsertion`/`JustInsertion`/`IncludingInsertion`.
* Changed `ISequenceMatcher.Encompass` declaration: `SequenceMatcherPastBoundsDirection direction` is now `SequenceMatcherEncompassDirection direction`, with values `Before`/`After`/`Both`.
* Changed `ISequenceBlockMatcher.Elements()` to return `IReadOnlyList<TElement>` instead of `IEnumerable<TElement>`.
* Renamed `ISequenceMatcher.MoveTo(Pointer/Block)Anchor(T(Pointer/Block)Anchor anchor)` to `ISequenceMatcher.(Pointer/Block)Matcher(T(Pointer/Block)Anchor anchor)`.
* Added `ISequencePointerMatcher.Element(out TElement element)` and `ISequenceBlockMatcher.Elements(out IReadOnlyList<TElement> elements)`.
* Added an additional `ISequence(Pointer/Block)Matcher.AsAnchorable()` overload for same `TPointerAnchor` and `TBlockAnchor` generic type arguments.
* Added `ISequence(Pointer/Block)Matcher.AsGuidAnchorable()`.
* Implemented some small potential optimizations.
